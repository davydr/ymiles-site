## What Is the 1099-K and Why Did I Get It?

If youâ€™re a part-time Uber driver, the tax paperwork can be overwhelming. One form youâ€™ll almost always hear about is the **1099-K**, which Uber may send to report your earnings. This guide will walk you through what the 1099-K is, how to read it, and â€” most importantly â€” how to use it with other Uber documents to accurately calculate what you owe.

Letâ€™s break it down step by step.

---

### Why You Got a 1099-K From Uber

Starting in 2024, the IRS lowered the federal threshold for receiving a 1099-K to **$10,000**. That means if you made at least $10,000 in rider payments through Uber, youâ€™ll get this form. Some states (like Massachusetts or Virginia) require Uber to send it even at **$600** or less, regardless of transaction count.

This doesnâ€™t mean you owe taxes on the full $10,000+. The IRS just wants to know what came in â€” **youâ€™re allowed to subtract legitimate expenses.**

---

### What the 1099-K Actually Shows

This form lists your **gross earnings** â€” every dollar a rider paid through the Uber app. That includes:
- Base fares
- Booking fees
- Tolls and surcharges
- Tips (yes, even tips)
- Promotions
- Bonuses
- Even money Uber hasnâ€™t paid you yet

Itâ€™s everything that came **through** Uber from your riders. But hereâ€™s the catch: **Uberâ€™s cut is still included** in that number.

If your 1099-K says $12,000, that doesnâ€™t mean you actually took home $12,000. You probably only received $9,000 or $10,000 after Uberâ€™s fees â€” and you **should not** be taxed on money you never received.

### Use the Uber Tax Summary Document

Uber knows this number is confusing. Thatâ€™s why they also give you a second, lesser-known document called the **Uber Tax Summary**.

This PDF breaks down:
- **Uber service fees**
- **Other Uber-related expenses**
- **Tolls reimbursed**
- **Promotions and incentives**
- **Actual net payout**

Itâ€™s your best friend at tax time. Youâ€™ll subtract Uberâ€™s fees listed in the Tax Summary when you file. If your 1099-K is $12,000 and Uberâ€™s fees were $2,400, your real income drops to $9,600 before your own business expenses.

**Use all three documents together:**
1. **1099-K** â€“ Total gross earnings
2. **Uber Tax Summary** â€“ Uberâ€™s cut and reimbursements
3. **Mileage + Expense Tracker** â€“ Your deductions

### How to Use Your 1099-K to File Taxes

Most Uber drivers use **Schedule C** to report income from self-employment.

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of how it works:

1. Start with the total from your **1099-K**
2. Subtract Uber fees (from the **Tax Summary**)
3. Subtract your business expenses (like **mileage**, snacks, car washes, etc.)
4. The result is your **net income**
5. You pay taxes on the **net**, not the gross

> ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: The IRS lets you deduct **67 cents per mile** driven in 2024 (standard mileage rate). That adds up fast.

---

### What Can You Deduct?

Common Uber-related tax deductions include:
- **Mileage** (your biggest one!)
- Phone plan (portion used for navigation)
- Snacks and water for riders
- Car cleaning or detailing
- Tolls and parking (not reimbursed)
- Vehicle depreciation or lease costs
- Floor mats, phone mounts, or chargers

If you're using my **mileage tracker** and the **Uber Deductions Checklist**, youâ€™ll be well ahead of the average driver.

### Donâ€™t Ignore the 1099-K â€” Even If You Didnâ€™t Get One

Letâ€™s say you didnâ€™t hit $10,000 or live in a state with a higher threshold. You still have to report income from Uber â€” even if you **donâ€™t** receive a 1099-K.

The IRS rule is simple: **if you earned income, report it.** Use your Uber payout history and Tax Summary PDF to find your total.

### Worried Youâ€™ll Owe a Lot? Hereâ€™s Some Good News

If youâ€™ve used the tools I offer â€” like the **deductions checklist** and **mileage log** â€” itâ€™s extremely unlikely that youâ€™ll owe a large amount.

Hereâ€™s why:
- Most part-time drivers deduct **thousands in mileage**
- Uberâ€™s fees are significant and **fully deductible**
- Many part-timers donâ€™t cross the **$1,000 net income threshold** that triggers quarterly tax payments

The **quarterly tax payment** rule only applies if you expect to owe more than $1,000 in **self-employment tax** at the end of the year. With good tracking, most part-time drivers donâ€™t even come close to that.

### Example: How It Might Look

Letâ€™s say you drove part-time in 2024:

| Item                            | Amount      |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| 1099-K gross income             | $12,000     |
| Minus Uber fees                 | -$2,400     |
| Mileage deduction (5,000 miles) | -$3,350     |
| Snacks, phone, cleaning         | -$300       |
| **Taxable self-employment income** | **$5,950** |

Now you're only taxed on $5,950 â€” not $12,000. Big difference, right?
