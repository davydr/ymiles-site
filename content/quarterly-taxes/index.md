## Do I Need to Pay Quarterly Taxes as an Uber Driver?

If you drive for Uber part-time, you may have heard that self-employed people are required to make **quarterly estimated tax payments**. While that’s true for some drivers, it likely doesn’t apply to you — and here’s why.

The IRS only requires quarterly tax payments if you expect to owe **more than $1,000 in taxes** at the end of the year. But that number is calculated **after** all of your deductions — not based on your total earnings.

For example, let’s say you bring in $10,000 from Uber for the year. That sounds like a lot, but after subtracting **Uber’s platform fees**, **standard mileage deductions**, and other business expenses like phone use and car cleaning, your taxable income can drop quickly. If you’re using my **free mileage tracking tools** and the **deductions checklist**, you’re likely left with a net profit well under $1,000 — and that means **no quarterly tax payment is required.**

However, **if you do net more than $1,000** and don’t make quarterly payments, you could be penalized at tax time. The IRS may charge interest or add fees to your balance, even if you plan to pay everything in April.

So the safest approach is to:
- Track your expenses closely
- Use your Uber Tax Summary
- Calculate your net income honestly
- Monitor whether you’re getting close to that $1,000 threshold

Most part-time Uber drivers — especially those using the tools on this site — **won’t owe quarterly taxes**. But it’s always good to understand the rule and make sure you stay compliant.
