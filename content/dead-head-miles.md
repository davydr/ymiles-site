## Understanding Dead Head Miles

Not all miles are created equal — at least not according to the IRS. If you're an Uber driver, it's important to know **which miles are deductible** and which aren’t. One gray area for many drivers is **dead head miles** — the miles you drive between trips, or while repositioning.

Here’s what the IRS says:  
You **cannot deduct** the miles from your home to your first rider pickup **unless** you're using the app and receive a ping before leaving. In that case, your drive from home **does count**, but only if you were already “on duty.”

If you sit at home with the app open and get a ping, you can count the miles from your house to that pickup. If you leave the house before receiving a ping, those initial miles are considered commuting — and they are **not deductible**.

### My Strategy to Capture More Deductible Miles

Uber’s app doesn't always help you return home efficiently. Their “destination filter” works maybe 20% of the time. That’s why I use a strategy:

1. I let Uber take me wherever on my last ride.
2. Then I **go offline** and reposition to a better area closer to home.
3. Once there, I turn the app back on and try to get one last cheap ride (under $10) that ends near my house.

That repositioning leg — up to **20 miles per night**, two nights a week — adds up fast. Over a 40-week driving year, that’s **1,600 miles** of legitimate, deductible mileage that Uber doesn’t track — but **my tool does**.
