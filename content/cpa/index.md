# Help Us Build YMiles, a Family-First LLC Strategy

Seeking an experienced CPA to support our tax strategy, family payroll, and long-term wealth goals

## About Our LLC
We’ve recently converted a high-paying W-2 DevOps job into an LLC that earns $230,000 annually. This LLC has two operating divisions:
- **Division 1: YMiles** – Focused on rideshare tax education and services, digital content, and YouTube monetization (no revenue yet)
- **Division 2: DevOps Consulting** – Provides infrastructure and automation services

Our vision is to run both divisions under one LLC structure that enables long-term tax planning, retireent contributions, and family employment.
