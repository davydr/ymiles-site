## What Is Schedule C and Why Uber Drivers Need It

If you drive for Uber — even part time — you’re considered **self-employed** by the IRS. That means you don’t receive a W-2, and Uber doesn’t withhold taxes from your payouts. Instead, you’re responsible for reporting your income and expenses using a form called **Schedule C**.

Schedule C is where you calculate your **net profit** as a business. It’s where you report the income from your **1099-K** and **1099-NEC**, then subtract all of your **deductions** like mileage, Uber fees, phone use, and car cleaning.

Even if you only drive part time, Schedule C lets you:
- Lower your taxable income
- Stay compliant
- Avoid IRS penalties

---

## What Industry Code Should I Use?

The IRS asks for a business activity code on Line B of Schedule C.  
For Uber drivers, the correct code is:

**485300 – Taxi and Limousine Service**

You can simply list your business name as "Self" or "Uber Driver" and use this code even if you’re not driving a traditional taxi.

## How Schedule C Is Structured


Even though Schedule C looks like one form, it actually has **multiple sections (or “worksheets”)** that all funnel into the **main summary lines** on the first page. Think of it like this:

---

##  Schedule C Structure for Uber Drivers

### **Page 1: The Summary Page (Lines 1–31)**

This is where you enter your **gross income**, subtract your **expenses**, and end up with your **net profit** on **Line 31**. That final number flows to your main tax return (Form 1040).

But most of the numbers on Page 1 come from calculations you do on **worksheets behind the scenes** — either built into tax software or found in the official form instructions.

---

##  Behind-the-Scenes Sections

### 1. **Part II – Expenses (Lines 8–27a)**  
This is where you list each business expense **by category**:
- Line 9: Car & truck expenses (this is where your **mileage** or **actual car costs** go)
- Line 17: Legal and professional services (like tax prep)
- Line 25: Utilities (portion of your phone bill)
- Line 27a: Other expenses (like snacks, cleaning supplies)

You can **attach a separate sheet** if you need to list “Other Expenses” in detail.

---

### 2. **Mileage Worksheet (optional)**  
If you're using the **standard mileage deduction**, the IRS doesn’t require a separate form — but they expect you to have a **log book**. Some tax software will include a built-in mileage worksheet to help calculate Line 9.

That’s where **your tool** is so useful — it creates an IRS-compliant logbook that justifies the number that ends up on Line 9.

---

### 3. **Cost of Goods Sold (Part III)**  
Most Uber drivers skip this — it’s only used if you sell products (not services).

---

### 4. **Vehicle Information (Part IV)**  
If you’re claiming mileage (Line 9), you must fill out this part:
- When you started using the vehicle
- Total miles driven vs. business miles
- Whether you have written records (yes — you do!)

Again, your mileage log tool fills the gap here.

---

## Putting It All Together

1. You enter your **gross income** from the 1099-K and 1099-NEC on Line 1.
2. You subtract your **expenses** line by line in Part II.
3. The IRS wants backup info for those expenses — that’s where the worksheets come in.
4. The **final result** (Line 31) is your **net profit**, and it goes onto **Form 1040, Schedule 1, Line 3**.



### What About a Log Book?

The IRS requires a **mileage log** — Uber’s year-end summary isn’t enough.  
That’s why using a real tracking tool matters. It protects you during an audit and helps you claim **every mile** you’re entitled to, including dead head miles between trips.

## Can You Deduct Last Year’s TurboTax Bill?

Yes — but **only the portion related to your business taxes**, not your personal return.

If you used TurboTax (or any other service) to file your taxes last year, and part of that service helped you prepare **Schedule C** for your Uber driving, then that portion is deductible as a **business expense**.

---

## Where to Put It on Schedule C

Enter it on:

** Line 17: Legal and Professional Services**

> This line covers fees paid for:
> - Tax preparation related to your business
> - Consultations or advice about your Uber taxes
> - Business-only filing software costs (or the business portion of personal software)

---

### Example:

- TurboTax Self-Employed: $130
- Estimated business use: 60%
- Deductible amount: $78  
- Enter **$78** on Line 17
