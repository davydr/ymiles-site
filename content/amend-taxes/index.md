## Go Back and Save: Dead Head Miles from Past Years Still Count

If you’ve been driving for Uber part time and haven’t been tracking **dead head miles**, you could be leaving **hundreds of dollars** in unclaimed deductions on the table — even from **previous tax years**.

The IRS allows you to **amend your tax return** for up to **three years**, which means you can still go back and claim mileage you missed — including **deadhead miles** Uber didn’t track for you.

### What Are Dead Head Miles?

These are the miles you drive **between trips**, **to reposition closer to home**, or **to get to a hotspot after going offline**. Uber’s trip summary does not record these miles — but the IRS allows them if properly logged.

If you reposition 20 miles twice per week for 40 weeks, that’s **1,600 extra miles**. At the 2024 IRS rate of **67 cents per mile**, that’s:

> **1,600 x $0.67 = $1,072 in additional deductions**

Even just one year of this missed mileage could reduce your taxable income enough to get money back — especially if you amend multiple years.
