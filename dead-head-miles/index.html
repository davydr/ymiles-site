    <meta name="description" content="Understanding Dead Head Miles
Not all miles are created equal — at least not according to the IRS. If you&rsquo;re an Uber driver, it&rsquo;s important to know which miles are deductible and which aren’t. One gray area for many drivers is dead head miles — the miles you drive between trips, or while repositioning.
Here’s what the IRS says:
You cannot deduct the miles from your home to your first rider pickup unless you&rsquo;re using the app and receive a ping before leaving. In that case, your drive from home does count, but only if you were already “on duty.”">

<p>Not all miles are created equal — at least not according to the IRS. If you&rsquo;re an Uber driver, it&rsquo;s important to know <strong>which miles are deductible</strong> and which aren’t. One gray area for many drivers is <strong>dead head miles</strong> — the miles you drive between trips, or while repositioning.</p>
<p>Here’s what the IRS says:<br>
You <strong>cannot deduct</strong> the miles from your home to your first rider pickup <strong>unless</strong> you&rsquo;re using the app and receive a ping before leaving. In that case, your drive from home <strong>does count</strong>, but only if you were already “on duty.”</p>
<p>If you sit at home with the app open and get a ping, you can count the miles from your house to that pickup. If you leave the house before receiving a ping, those initial miles are considered commuting — and they are <strong>not deductible</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="my-strategy-to-capture-more-deductible-miles">My Strategy to Capture More Deductible Miles</h3>
<p>Uber’s app doesn&rsquo;t always help you return home efficiently. Their “destination filter” works maybe 20% of the time. That’s why I use a strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>I let Uber take me wherever on my last ride.</li>
<li>Then I <strong>go offline</strong> and reposition to a better area closer to home.</li>
<li>Once there, I turn the app back on and try to get one last cheap ride (under $10) that ends near my house.</li>
</ol>
<p>That repositioning leg — up to <strong>20 miles per night</strong>, two nights a week — adds up fast. Over a 40-week driving year, that’s <strong>1,600 miles</strong> of legitimate, deductible mileage that Uber doesn’t track — but <strong>my tool does</strong>.</p>
