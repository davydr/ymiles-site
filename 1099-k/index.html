This guide will walk you through what the 1099-K is, how to read it, and â€” most importantly â€” how to use it with other Uber documents to accurately calculate what you owe."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.146.6"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/custom.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/favicon.ico type=image/x-icon><link rel=canonical href=https://ymiles.com/1099-k/><meta property="og:url" content="https://ymiles.com/1099-k/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="YMiles Rideshare"><meta property="og:title" content="Understanding Your 1099-K"><meta property="og:description" content="What Is the 1099-K and Why Did I Get It?

One form youâ€™ll almost always hear about is the <strong>1099-K</strong>, which Uber may send to report your earnings. This guide will walk you through what the 1099-K is, how to read it, and â€” most importantly â€” how to use it with other Uber documents to accurately calculate what you owe.</p><p>Letâ€™s break it down step by step.</p><hr><h3 id=why-you-got-a-1099-k-from-uber>Why You Got a 1099-K From Uber</h3><p>Starting in 2024, the IRS lowered the federal threshold for receiving a 1099-K to <strong>$5,000</strong>. This was $20,000 last year and will be reduced to $600 by 2026. That means if you made at least $5,000 in rider payments through Uber, youâ€™ll get this form. Some states (like Massachusetts or Virginia) require Uber to send it even at <strong>$600</strong> or less, regardless of transaction count.</p><p>This doesnâ€™t mean you owe taxes on the full $5,000+. The IRS just wants to know what came in â€” <strong>youâ€™re allowed to subtract legitimate expenses.</strong></p><hr><h3 id=what-the-1099-k-actually-shows>What the 1099-K Actually Shows</h3><p>This form lists your <strong>gross earnings</strong> â€” every dollar a rider paid through the Uber app. That includes:</p><ul><li>Base fares</li><li>Booking fees</li><li>Tolls and surcharges</li><li>Tips (yes, even tips)</li><li>Promotions</li><li>Bonuses</li><li>Even money Uber hasnâ€™t paid you yet</li></ul><p>Itâ€™s everything that came <strong>through</strong> Uber from your riders. But hereâ€™s the catch: <strong>Uberâ€™s cut is still included</strong> in that number.</p><p>If your 1099-K says $12,000, that doesnâ€™t mean you actually took home $12,000. You probably only received $9,000 or $10,000 after Uberâ€™s fees â€” and you <strong>should not</strong> be taxed on money you never received.</p><hr><h3 id=use-the-uber-tax-summary-document>Use the Uber Tax Summary Document</h3><p>Uber knows this number is confusing. Thatâ€™s why they also give you a second, lesser-known document called the <strong>Uber Tax Summary</strong>.</p><p>This PDF breaks down:</p><ul><li><strong>Uber service fees</strong></li><li><strong>Other Uber-related expenses</strong></li><li><strong>Tolls reimbursed</strong></li><li><strong>Promotions and incentives</strong></li><li><strong>Actual net payout</strong></li></ul><p>Itâ€™s your best friend at tax time. Youâ€™ll subtract Uberâ€™s fees listed in the Tax Summary when you file. If your 1099-K is $12,000 and Uberâ€™s fees were $2,400, your real income drops to $9,600 before your own business expenses.</p><p><strong>Use all three documents together:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>1099-K</strong> â€“ Total gross earnings</li><li><strong>Uber Tax Summary</strong> â€“ Uberâ€™s cut and reimbursements</li><li><strong>Mileage + Expense Tracker</strong> â€“ Your deductions</li></ol><hr><h3 id=how-to-use-your-1099-k-to-file-taxes>How to Use Your 1099-K to File Taxes</h3><p>Most Uber drivers use <strong>Schedule C</strong> to report income from self-employment.</p><p>Hereâ€™s a simplified version of how it works:</p><ol><li>Start with the total from your <strong>1099-K</strong></li><li>Subtract Uber fees (from the <strong>Tax Summary</strong>)</li><li>Subtract your business expenses (like <strong>mileage</strong>, snacks, car washes, etc.)</li><li>The result is your <strong>net income</strong></li><li>You pay taxes on the <strong>net</strong>, not the gross</li></ol><blockquote><p>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: The IRS lets you deduct <strong>67 cents per mile</strong> driven in 2024 (standard mileage rate). That adds up fast.</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id=what-can-you-deduct>What Can You Deduct?</h3><p>Common Uber-related tax deductions include:</p><ul><li><strong>Mileage</strong> (your biggest one!)</li><li>Phone plan (portion used for navigation)</li><li>Snacks and water for riders</li><li>Car cleaning or detailing</li><li>Tolls and parking (not reimbursed)</li><li>Vehicle depreciation or lease costs</li><li>Floor mats, phone mounts, or chargers</li></ul><p>If you&rsquo;re using my <strong>mileage tracker</strong> and the <strong>Uber Deductions Checklist</strong>, youâ€™ll be well ahead of the average driver.</p><hr><h3 id=dont-ignore-the-1099-k--even-if-you-didnt-get-one>Donâ€™t Ignore the 1099-K â€” Even If You Didnâ€™t Get One</h3><p>Letâ€™s say you didnâ€™t hit $10,000 or live in a state with a higher threshold. You still have to report income from Uber â€” even if you <strong>donâ€™t</strong> receive a 1099-K.</p><p>The IRS rule is simple: <strong>if you earned income, report it.</strong> Use your Uber payout history and Tax Summary PDF to find your total.</p><hr><h3 id=worried-youll-owe-a-lot-heres-some-good-news>Worried Youâ€™ll Owe a Lot? Hereâ€™s Some Good News</h3><p>If youâ€™ve used the tools I offer â€” like the <strong>deductions checklist</strong> and <strong>mileage log</strong> â€” itâ€™s extremely unlikely that youâ€™ll owe a large amount.</p><p>Hereâ€™s why:</p><ul><li>Most part-time drivers deduct <strong>thousands in mileage</strong></li><li>Uberâ€™s fees are significant and <strong>fully deductible</strong></li><li>Many part-timers donâ€™t cross the <strong>$1,000 net income threshold</strong> that triggers quarterly tax payments</li></ul><p>The <strong>quarterly tax payment</strong> rule only applies if you expect to owe more than $1,000 in <strong>self-employment tax</strong> at the end of the year. With good tracking, most part-time drivers donâ€™t even come close to that.</p><hr><h3 id=example-how-it-might-look>Example: How It Might Look</h3><p>Letâ€™s say you drove part-time in 2024:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1099-K gross income</td><td>$12,000</td></tr><tr><td>Minus Uber fees</td><td>-$2,400</td></tr><tr><td>Mileage deduction (5,000 miles)</td><td>-$3,350</td></tr><tr><td>Snacks, phone, cleaning</td><td>-$300</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Taxable self-employment income</strong></td><td><strong>$5,950</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now you&rsquo;re only taxed on $5,950 â€” not $12,000. Big difference, right?</p><hr><h3 id=final-checklist-for-your-1099-k>Final Checklist for Your 1099-K</h3><p>Hereâ€™s what to do when you receive the form:</p><ol><li>âœ… Download the 1099-K and the <strong>Uber Tax Summary</strong></li><li>âœ… Use the <strong>checklist</strong> and <strong>mileage tool</strong> I provide to subtract business expenses</li><li>âœ… File Schedule C with your net income only</li><li>âœ… Ask for help if you&rsquo;re not sure â€” I offer training and tax prep options</li></ol><hr><h3 id=want-extra-help>Want Extra Help?</h3><p>I offer:</p><ul><li><strong>Free training videos</strong> for Uber drivers</li><li>A <strong>printable deductions checklist</strong></li><li>A <strong>step-by-step video</strong> on how to file your taxes using your 1099-K</li><li>Personalized help if you want me to walk you through it</li></ul><p>You can access all of that on the <a href=/training/>Training Page</a>.</p><hr><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://ymiles.com/>&copy; YMiles Rideshare 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
