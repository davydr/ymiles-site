<p>If you’ve been driving for Uber part time and haven’t been tracking <strong>dead head miles</strong>, you could be leaving <strong>hundreds of dollars</strong> in unclaimed deductions on the table — even from <strong>previous tax years</strong>.</p>
<p>The IRS allows you to <strong>amend your tax return</strong> for up to <strong>three years</strong>, which means you can still go back and claim mileage you missed — including <strong>deadhead miles</strong> Uber didn’t track for you.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-are-dead-head-miles">What Are Dead Head Miles?</h3>
<p>These are the miles you drive <strong>between trips</strong>, <strong>to reposition closer to home</strong>, or <strong>to get to a hotspot after going offline</strong>. Uber’s trip summary does not record these miles — but the IRS allows them if properly logged.</p>
<p>If you reposition 20 miles twice per week for 40 weeks, that’s <strong>1,600 extra miles</strong>. At the 2024 IRS rate of <strong>67 cents per mile</strong>, that’s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1,600 x $0.67 = $1,072 in additional deductions</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Even just one year of this missed mileage could reduce your taxable income enough to get money back — especially if you amend multiple years.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-the-tool-is-worth-it">Why the Tool Is Worth It</h3>
<p>My mileage log tool helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reconstruct past driving habits</li>
<li>Identify dead head mileage using simple prompts</li>
<li>Create an IRS-ready log book for amended returns</li>
<li>Save <strong>much more than $25/year</strong> — even retroactively</li>
</ul>
<p>If you missed 1,600 miles in one year, you’ve already missed out on $1,000+ in deductions. The tool costs <strong>only $25 per year</strong>, and helps you go back and fix that — while setting you up right for this year.</p>

<p>Grab the tool now and start recovering what you missed.</p>
