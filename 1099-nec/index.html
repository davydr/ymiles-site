<h2 id="-how-to-use-the-1099-nec-from-uber">üßæ How to Use the 1099-NEC From Uber</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re a part-time Uber driver, you may receive more than one tax form. While most people know about the 1099-K, Uber drivers may also receive a <strong>1099-NEC</strong>. This form reports income that didn&rsquo;t come directly from your passengers, and it often catches drivers off guard.</p>
<p>This guide explains what the 1099-NEC is, why you might receive one, and how to use it alongside your 1099-K and Uber Tax Summary to file your taxes correctly ‚Äî without paying more than you need to.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-is-the-1099-nec">What Is the 1099-NEC?</h3>
<p>The <strong>1099-NEC</strong> stands for <strong>Nonemployee Compensation</strong>. It was reintroduced by the IRS in 2020 to separate gig economy earnings and contractor payments from other types of income. If you received bonuses, incentives, or referrals from Uber, the 1099-NEC is how Uber reports that income to the IRS.</p>
<p>The key distinction is this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1099-K</strong> = money paid by passengers (gross earnings through the app)</li>
<li><strong>1099-NEC</strong> = money paid directly to you by Uber (bonuses, promos, and more)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you didn‚Äôt earn a lot, Uber may still issue a 1099-NEC if the total hits $600 or more.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-did-i-get-a-1099-nec-from-uber">Why Did I Get a 1099-NEC From Uber?</h3>
<p>You‚Äôll get a 1099-NEC if you earned at least <strong>$600 in non-passenger earnings</strong>. These earnings might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Referral bonuses</strong> for getting other drivers or riders to sign up</li>
<li><strong>Quest or promotion bonuses</strong> (like ‚Äúearn $50 after 20 rides‚Äù)</li>
<li><strong>One-time bonuses or incentives</strong></li>
<li>Certain <strong>market adjustments or incentives</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These payments are <strong>not</strong> processed through the app as rider fares. They‚Äôre Uber‚Äôs money, sent directly to you.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-does-the-1099-nec-affect-my-taxes">How Does the 1099-NEC Affect My Taxes?</h3>
<p>The 1099-NEC is still considered <strong>self-employment income</strong>. Just like your 1099-K, it must be reported on <strong>Schedule C</strong> of your tax return.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>1099-K goes on Schedule C as gross receipts from services</li>
<li>1099-NEC income also goes on Schedule C, but you may want to separate it for clarity</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, both forms add up to your total Uber income ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the number the IRS expects you to report and subtract expenses from.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="can-i-deduct-expenses-against-my-1099-nec">Can I Deduct Expenses Against My 1099-NEC?</h3>
<p>Yes. The IRS allows you to deduct ordinary and necessary expenses related to earning any income, including the money reported on your 1099-NEC.</p>
<p>That means you can deduct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mileage</li>
<li>Tolls</li>
<li>Uber fees</li>
<li>Cleaning</li>
<li>Supplies</li>
<li>Cell phone costs</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the income came from driving for Uber, <strong>you can treat it the same way as 1099-K income</strong> when it comes to deductions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="example-breakdown">Example Breakdown</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs say you made:</p>
<ul>
<li>$8,000 on your 1099-K</li>
<li>$750 on your 1099-NEC (for Quest promos and sign-up bonuses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your total Uber income = $8,750</p>
<p>If your Uber Tax Summary says you paid $1,200 in Uber fees, and your deductions (mileage, car cleaning, phone, etc.) add up to $3,000, here‚Äôs what happens:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Income &amp; Expenses</th>
          <th>Amount</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>1099-K income</td>
          <td>$8,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>1099-NEC income</td>
          <td>$750</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Total Uber income</strong></td>
          <td>$8,750</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Less Uber fees (from summary)</td>
          <td>-$1,200</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Less personal deductions</td>
          <td>-$3,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Net profit on Schedule C</strong></td>
          <td>$4,550</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This is what you‚Äôd be taxed on ‚Äî <strong>not</strong> the full $8,750.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-if-i-didnt-get-a-1099-nec">What If I Didn‚Äôt Get a 1099-NEC?</h3>
<p>That‚Äôs fine ‚Äî not every driver gets one.</p>
<p>If you didn‚Äôt earn at least $600 in promotions, Uber is not required to send a 1099-NEC. However, you may still have earned bonuses that need to be reported. You can find them in your <strong>Uber Tax Summary</strong>.</p>
<p>If you see ‚ÄúIncentives‚Äù or ‚ÄúOther earnings‚Äù listed in your summary, add those to your Schedule C income manually, even if you didn‚Äôt receive a form.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-to-use-the-1099-nec-with-your-other-tax-documents">How to Use the 1099-NEC With Your Other Tax Documents</h3>
<p>Here‚Äôs the full flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with your <strong>1099-K</strong> total</li>
<li>Add any <strong>1099-NEC</strong> income</li>
<li>Cross-check both forms with your <strong>Uber Tax Summary</strong></li>
<li>Subtract <strong>Uber fees</strong></li>
<li>Subtract your own <strong>deductions</strong> using the checklist and mileage tracker</li>
<li>Report the <strong>net result</strong> on Schedule C</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember ‚Äî the IRS gets a copy of both your 1099-K and 1099-NEC. If you forget to include one, you may get a letter from them asking you to fix it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-if-i-file-this-incorrectly">What if I File This Incorrectly?</h3>
<p>Filing errors involving the 1099-NEC usually fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>forget to include it</strong></li>
<li>You <strong>double count</strong> bonus income already included in the 1099-K (rare)</li>
<li>You <strong>don‚Äôt deduct any expenses</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these can cause you to overpay or trigger an audit notice.</p>
<p>The good news? If you use my free tax checklist and mileage tools, your odds of filing correctly ‚Äî and saving money ‚Äî go way up.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="do-i-need-to-pay-quarterly-taxes-because-of-the-1099-nec">Do I Need to Pay Quarterly Taxes Because of the 1099-NEC?</h3>
<p>Probably not ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre a part-time driver.</p>
<p>The IRS only requires quarterly estimated tax payments if you expect to owe <strong>more than $1,000</strong> in taxes at the end of the year. That‚Äôs usually not the case for part-time Uber drivers who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track mileage carefully</li>
<li>Use the Uber Tax Summary to subtract fees</li>
<li>Deduct business expenses with my tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with both forms, most drivers‚Äô net income stays below that $1,000 mark after deductions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>The 1099-NEC isn‚Äôt something to fear ‚Äî it‚Äôs just one piece of your Uber tax puzzle. As long as you include it with your other income and subtract legitimate expenses, you‚Äôre doing everything the IRS expects.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre using the tools and training I provide on this site, you‚Äôll likely come out ahead ‚Äî with more deductions, fewer headaches, and less money owed at tax time.</p>
