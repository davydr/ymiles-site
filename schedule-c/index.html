If you drive for Uber ‚Äî even part time ‚Äî you‚Äôre considered self-employed by the IRS. That means you don‚Äôt receive a W-2, and Uber doesn‚Äôt withhold taxes from your payouts. Instead, you‚Äôre responsible for reporting your income and expenses using a form called Schedule C.
Schedule C is where you calculate your net profit as a business. It‚Äôs where you report the income from your 1099-K and 1099-NEC, then subtract all of your deductions like mileage, Uber fees, phone use, and car cleaning.">

        <h2 id="what-is-schedule-c-and-why-uber-drivers-need-it">What Is Schedule C and Why Uber Drivers Need It</h2>
<p>If you drive for Uber ‚Äî even part time ‚Äî you‚Äôre considered <strong>self-employed</strong> by the IRS. That means you don‚Äôt receive a W-2, and Uber doesn‚Äôt withhold taxes from your payouts. Instead, you‚Äôre responsible for reporting your income and expenses using a form called <strong>Schedule C</strong>.</p>
<p>Schedule C is where you calculate your <strong>net profit</strong> as a business. It‚Äôs where you report the income from your <strong>1099-K</strong> and <strong>1099-NEC</strong>, then subtract all of your <strong>deductions</strong> like mileage, Uber fees, phone use, and car cleaning.</p>
<p>Even if you only drive part time, Schedule C lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower your taxable income</li>
<li>Stay compliant</li>
<li>Avoid IRS penalties</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-industry-code-should-i-use">What Industry Code Should I Use?</h2>
<p>The IRS asks for a business activity code on Line B of Schedule C.<br>
For Uber drivers, the correct code is:</p>
<p><strong>485300 ‚Äì Taxi and Limousine Service</strong></p>
<p>You can simply list your business name as &ldquo;Self&rdquo; or &ldquo;Uber Driver&rdquo; and use this code even if you‚Äôre not driving a traditional taxi.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-schedule-c-is-structured">How Schedule C Is Structured</h2>
<p>Even though Schedule C looks like one form, it actually has <strong>multiple sections (or ‚Äúworksheets‚Äù)</strong> that all funnel into the <strong>main summary lines</strong> on the first page. Think of it like this:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="schedule-c-structure-for-uber-drivers">Schedule C Structure for Uber Drivers</h2>
<h3 id="-page-1-the-summary-page-lines-131">üîπ <strong>Page 1: The Summary Page (Lines 1‚Äì31)</strong></h3>
<p>This is where you enter your <strong>gross income</strong>, subtract your <strong>expenses</strong>, and end up with your <strong>net profit</strong> on <strong>Line 31</strong>. That final number flows to your main tax return (Form 1040).</p>
<p>But most of the numbers on Page 1 come from calculations you do on <strong>worksheets behind the scenes</strong> ‚Äî either built into tax software or found in the official form instructions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-behind-the-scenes-sections">üîç Behind-the-Scenes Sections</h2>
<h3 id="1-part-ii--expenses-lines-827a">1. <strong>Part II ‚Äì Expenses (Lines 8‚Äì27a)</strong></h3>
<p>This is where you list each business expense <strong>by category</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 9: Car &amp; truck expenses (this is where your <strong>mileage</strong> or <strong>actual car costs</strong> go)</li>
<li>Line 17: Legal and professional services (like tax prep)</li>
<li>Line 25: Utilities (portion of your phone bill)</li>
<li>Line 27a: Other expenses (like snacks, cleaning supplies)</li>
</ul>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è You can <strong>attach a separate sheet</strong> if you need to list ‚ÄúOther Expenses‚Äù in detail.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-mileage-worksheet-optional">2. <strong>Mileage Worksheet (optional)</strong></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using the <strong>standard mileage deduction</strong>, the IRS doesn‚Äôt require a separate form ‚Äî but they expect you to have a <strong>log book</strong>. Some tax software will include a built-in mileage worksheet to help calculate Line 9.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs where <strong>your tool</strong> is so useful ‚Äî it creates an IRS-compliant logbook that justifies the number that ends up on Line 9.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-cost-of-goods-sold-part-iii">3. <strong>Cost of Goods Sold (Part III)</strong></h3>
<p>Most Uber drivers skip this ‚Äî it‚Äôs only used if you sell products (not services).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-vehicle-information-part-iv">4. <strong>Vehicle Information (Part IV)</strong></h3>
<p>If you‚Äôre claiming mileage (Line 9), you must fill out this part:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you started using the vehicle</li>
<li>Total miles driven vs. business miles</li>
<li>Whether you have written records (yes ‚Äî you do!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, your mileage log tool fills the gap here.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<ol>
<li>You enter your <strong>gross income</strong> from the 1099-K and 1099-NEC on Line 1.</li>
<li>You subtract your <strong>expenses</strong> line by line in Part II.</li>
<li>The IRS wants backup info for those expenses ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the worksheets come in.</li>
<li>The <strong>final result</strong> (Line 31) is your <strong>net profit</strong>, and it goes onto <strong>Form 1040, Schedule 1, Line 3</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-about-a-log-book">What About a Log Book?</h3>
<p>The IRS requires a <strong>mileage log</strong> ‚Äî Uber‚Äôs year-end summary isn‚Äôt enough.<br>
That‚Äôs why using a real tracking tool matters. It protects you during an audit and helps you claim <strong>every mile</strong> you‚Äôre entitled to, including dead head miles between trips.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="can-you-deduct-last-years-turbotax-bill">Can You Deduct Last Year‚Äôs TurboTax Bill?</h2>
<p>Yes ‚Äî but <strong>only the portion related to your business taxes</strong>, not your personal return.</p>
<p>If you used TurboTax (or any other service) to file your taxes last year, and part of that service helped you prepare <strong>Schedule C</strong> for your Uber driving, then that portion is deductible as a <strong>business expense</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="where-to-put-it-on-schedule-c">Where to Put It on Schedule C</h2>
<p>Enter it on:</p>
<p>** Line 17: Legal and Professional Services**</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This line covers fees paid for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax preparation related to your business</li>
<li>Consultations or advice about your Uber taxes</li>
<li>Business-only filing software costs (or the business portion of personal software)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="example">Example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>TurboTax Self-Employed: $130</li>
<li>Estimated business use: 60%</li>
<li>Deductible amount: $78</li>
<li>Enter <strong>$78</strong> on Line 17</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>You can walk through every line of Schedule C using my <a href="/training/">paid training</a> or explore key topics in the free videos on this site. Everything is designed for part-time Uber drivers ‚Äî no accounting background required.</p>
