Seeking an experienced CPA to support our tax strategy, family payroll, and long-term wealth goals

About Our LLC
We’ve recently converted a high-paying W-2 DevOps job into an LLC that earns $230,000 annually. This LLC has two operating divisions:

Division 1: YMiles – Focused on rideshare tax education and services, digital content, and YouTube monetization (no revenue yet)
Division 2: DevOps Consulting – Provides infrastructure and automation services

Our vision is to run both divisions under one LLC structure that enables long-term tax planning, retireent contributions, and family employment."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.146.6"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/custom.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/favicon.ico type=image/x-icon><link rel=canonical href=https://ymiles.com/cpa/><meta property="og:url" content="https://ymiles.com/cpa/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="YMiles Rideshare"><meta property="og:title" content="YMiles Rideshare"><meta property="og:description" content="Help Us Build YMiles, a Family-First LLC Strategy Seeking an experienced CPA to support our tax strategy, family payroll, and long-term wealth goals
