      <description>Understanding Dead Head Miles Not all miles are created equal ‚Äî at least not according to the IRS. If you&amp;rsquo;re an Uber driver, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know which miles are deductible and which aren‚Äôt. One gray area for many drivers is dead head miles ‚Äî the miles you drive between trips, or while repositioning.&#xA;Here‚Äôs what the IRS says:&#xA;You cannot deduct the miles from your home to your first rider pickup unless you&amp;rsquo;re using the app and receive a ping before leaving.</description>

      <title>Do I Need to File a Schedule C?</title>

      <description>What Is Schedule C and Why Uber Drivers Need It If you drive for Uber ‚Äî even part time ‚Äî you‚Äôre considered self-employed by the IRS. That means you don‚Äôt receive a W-2, and Uber doesn‚Äôt withhold taxes from your payouts. Instead, you‚Äôre responsible for reporting your income and expenses using a form called Schedule C.&#xA;Schedule C is where you calculate your net profit as a business. It‚Äôs where you report the income from your 1099-K and 1099-NEC, then subtract all of your deductions like mileage, Uber fees, phone use, and car cleaning.</description>

      <description>Go Back and Save: Dead Head Miles from Past Years Still Count! If you‚Äôve been driving for Uber part time and haven‚Äôt been tracking dead head miles, you could be leaving hundreds of dollars in unclaimed deductions on the table ‚Äî even from previous tax years.&#xA;The IRS allows you to amend your tax return for up to three years, which means you can still go back and claim mileage you missed ‚Äî including deadhead miles Uber didn‚Äôt track for you.</description>

      <description>Do I Need to Pay Quarterly Taxes as an Uber Driver? If you drive for Uber part-time, you may have heard that self-employed people are required to make quarterly estimated tax payments. While that‚Äôs true for some drivers, it likely doesn‚Äôt apply to you ‚Äî and here‚Äôs why.&#xA;The IRS only requires quarterly tax payments if you expect to owe more than $1,000 in taxes at the end of the year.</description>

      <description>Uber Driver Deductions Checklist As a part-time Uber driver, one of the easiest ways to reduce your tax bill is by claiming the right deductions. This checklist breaks them into three categories to make filing simple.&#xA;1. Mileage Log Book (Built with My Tool) The IRS requires a log book to claim mileage deductions. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever audited, a general summary from Uber is not enough ‚Äî it must show dates, miles, and purpose of each trip.</description>

      <description>What Is the 1099-K and Why Did I Get It? If you‚Äôre a part-time Uber driver, the tax paperwork can be overwhelming.

      <description>How to Use the 1099-NEC From Uber When you&amp;rsquo;re a part-time Uber driver, you may receive more than one tax form. While most people know about the 1099-K, Uber drivers may also receive a 1099-NEC. This form reports income that didn&amp;rsquo;t come directly from your passengers, and it often catches drivers off guard.&#xA;This guide explains what the 1099-NEC is, why you might receive one, and how to use it alongside your 1099-K and Uber Tax Summary to file your taxes correctly ‚Äî without paying more than you need to.</description>
